29/10/24 - I've been struggling to write this but something is better than nothing. I'm not going to continue modding for the time being. Feel free to reach out if you want to work on ImpUI or any other UI mods. I just can't maintain mods on top of everything.

#### Description
This mod is aimed at making changes to the overall user interface to improve usability as well as opening options to more potential mods.

#### Patch 7 Features
#### Player Features
- Character Creation Layout tweaks: Redesigned Origin layout (the first screen you see when entering CC).
- Character Creation Layout tweaks: Adds full Facial Hair Colour selection.
- Character Respec tweaks: Adds Race and Background tabs, including racial passives that can be unselected then changed, and racial spells that can be switched.
- (Keyboard only) Character Creation Layout tweaks: Adds multiplayer tab that nests the multiplayer UI for Single Player, and allows the joining pop-up to appear for hosts when opened.
- (Keyboard only) CC/Level up Layout tweaks: Adds multiple scroll bars to Origins, Races, Subraces, Classes, Subclasses, Deity and Background selection for better support with modded options.
- (Controller only) Character Creation Layout tweaks: Hides appearance options when not relevant, adds "all colours" tickbox for highlights.
- (Controller only) Character Creation Layout tweaks: Adds slider values to options that have a numeric representation in the keyboard layout (Age, intensity).

#### Modder Features

#### Custom Action Resource Icon Features
- Support for 4 different icon types - Keyboard icon, Keyboard CC/lvlup, Controller front icon, Controller resource icon. (BETA)
